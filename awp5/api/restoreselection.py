RestoreSelection

The restore selection is used to prepare one or more files for the restore
operation. You must create new restore selection resource for each new restore
session. You can use the resource methods to populate the selection (i.e. add
files) and then submit the entire selection for immediate or scheduled
execution.
The restore selection is a temporary resource. It does not survive system
crashes and server shutdowns, nor it needs to be explicitly destroyed by the
caller. It goes out of scope by invoking the submit method, which effectively
passes the control to the Job manager. The owner of the archive selection
resource is thus the P5 system, so the caller needs not (nor it should) perform
any other task with the same resource.
Usage:
To use the RestoreSelection, you must first use the create method to create new
instance. After the creation, you use the addentry and/or findentry methods to
fill-in the selection with files to restore. Finally, you must submit the
selection for immediate or scheduled execution. After the submission, the
resource goes out of scope and should not be used any more.
